# **Inventory Management System**

The **Inventory Management System** is a simple Python project for
managing inventory records. It provides a lightweight and
beginner-friendly way to handle operations like displaying inventory,
adding new items, updating quantities, and deleting items. The system
uses a CSV file (inventory.csv) for storing data, ensuring that records
are saved even after the program is closed.

## **Features**

-   **View Inventory**: Display all items with their names, quantities,
    > and prices.

-   **Add Items**: Add new items to the inventory with ease.

-   **Update Quantities**: Modify the quantity of any existing item.

-   **Delete Items**: Remove items from the inventory by name.

-   **Persistent Storage**: Inventory data is stored in a CSV file for
    > easy access and editing.

## **Technologies Used**

-   **Python**: The entire system is implemented using Python,
    > leveraging its built-in csv module for file handling.

## **File Structure**

-   inventory_management.py: Main Python script containing the logic for
    > the system.

-   inventory.csv: CSV file where the inventory data is stored. This
    > file is automatically created when the program is run for the
    > first time.
